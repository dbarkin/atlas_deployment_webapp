- API requests should be optimized to reduce latency.
- The application should be able to scale with demand.
- Address potential bottlenecks, especially in the FastAPI backend.
- Define scaling strategies for both frontend and backend components.

### **Reliability & Maintainability**
- The application must have comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms.
- Implement structured logging for easier troubleshooting.
- Define specific logging patterns and monitoring tools.
- The architecture should allow easy maintenance and upgrades.
- CI/CD pipelines should be robust and handle failures gracefully.
- Implement detailed error handling for network failures, Terraform execution errors, and authentication failures.

### **Infrastructure & Hosting**
- Clearly define where Next.js and FastAPI components will be hosted.
- Detail deployment environments (development, staging, production) and infrastructure needs.
- Document network boundaries and security groups.

## 3. Solution Options Considered

### **Option 1: Using Google OAuth with NextAuth.js (Frontend Authentication Only)**
- **Pros:** Easy to integrate, built-in session management.
- **Cons:** Requires additional backend security mechanisms.

### **Option 2: Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In**
- **Pros:** Managed authentication and authorization.
- **Cons:** Introduces dependency on Firebase.

### **Option 3: Using Google OAuth with FastAPI Backend**
- **Pros:** Fully controlled authentication at backend.
- **Cons:** Requires more effort to handle token management.

### **Option 4: Combining NextAuth.js with FastAPI for Secure API Calls**
- **Pros:** Clean separation of frontend and backend responsibilities.
- **Cons:** Requires secure token validation and API protection.

---

## 4. Selected Solution: **Option 4 - NextAuth.js + FastAPI for Secure API Calls**

### **Why Option 4?**
- Leverages **NextAuth.js** for seamless authentication in the frontend.
- Ensures **FastAPI securely validates OAuth tokens** and applies RBAC.
- Provides **clean separation of concerns** between frontend (UI) and backend (API).
- Allows **secure API communication** using JWTs and HTTPS.
- Integrates well with **GitHub Actions for Terraform automation**.
