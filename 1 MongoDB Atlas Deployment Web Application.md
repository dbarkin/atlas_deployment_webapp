# MongoDB Atlas Deployment Web Application

## 1. Functional Requirements

### **User Authentication & Authorization**
- The system must authenticate users using **Google OAuth (Google IDP)**.
- Only authorized users should be able to access the application.
- The application must support **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

### **Terraform Deployment via GitHub CI/CD**
- Users must be able to trigger the deployment of a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**.
- The backend must trigger a **GitHub Actions pipeline** to run Terraform scripts.
- Terraform scripts should be stored in a **corporate GitHub repository**.

### **Frontend (Next.js) Responsibilities**
- Implement user authentication via **NextAuth.js**.
- Securely store session tokens (JWT or database-based).
- Send API requests to **FastAPI backend** with authentication tokens.

### **Backend (FastAPI) Responsibilities**
- Validate OAuth tokens from Google.
- Implement **RBAC** to control access to the CI/CD trigger.
- Securely trigger **GitHub Actions** via API.

### **Deployment & Database Management**
- The system must support automated MongoDB Atlas deployment.
- Terraform should handle cluster configuration and provisioning.
- The system must provide deployment logs for troubleshooting.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### **Security**
- OAuth token validation must be performed securely.
- Only authorized users should have access to deployment functionalities.
- API communication must be secured using HTTPS and CORS policies.
- GitHub Actions must use secure credentials for Terraform deployment.

### **Scalability & Performance**
- The system should be designed to handle multiple users securely.
- API requests should be optimized to reduce latency.
- The application should be able to scale with demand.

### **Reliability & Maintainability**
- The application must have logging and monitoring mechanisms.
- The architecture should allow easy maintenance and upgrades.
- CI/CD pipelines should be robust and handle failures gracefully.

## 3. Solution Options Considered

### **Option 1: Using Google OAuth with NextAuth.js (Frontend Authentication Only)**
- **Pros:** Easy to integrate, built-in session management.
- **Cons:** Requires additional backend security mechanisms.

### **Option 2: Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In**
- **Pros:** Managed authentication and authorization.
- **Cons:** Introduces dependency on Firebase.

### **Option 3: Using Google OAuth with FastAPI Backend**
- **Pros:** Fully controlled authentication at backend.
- **Cons:** Requires more effort to handle token management.

### **Option 4: Combining NextAuth.js with FastAPI for Secure API Calls**
- **Pros:** Clean separation of frontend and backend responsibilities.
- **Cons:** Requires secure token validation and API protection.

## 4. Selected Solution: **Option 4 - NextAuth.js + FastAPI for Secure API Calls**

### **Why Option 4?**
- Leverages **NextAuth.js** for seamless authentication in the frontend.
- Ensures **FastAPI securely validates OAuth tokens** and applies RBAC.
- Provides **clean separation of concerns** between frontend (UI) and backend (API).
- Allows **secure API communication** using JWTs and HTTPS.
- Integrates well with **GitHub Actions for Terraform automation**.

## 6. Security Considerations

### **OAuth Token Security**
- Use **Google OAuth JWTs** for authentication.
- Validate tokens at backend using Googleâ€™s public keys.

### **RBAC & Access Control**
- Only authorized users should trigger Terraform deployments.
- Implement **role-based access** at the FastAPI level.

### **API & Data Security**
- Secure all API communications over **HTTPS**.
- Implement **CORS policies** to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.
- Use **JWT-based authentication** for API access.

### **GitHub CI/CD Security**
- Use **GitHub Secrets** to store Terraform credentials securely.
- Ensure **least privilege access** for GitHub runners executing Terraform.

### **Logging & Monitoring**
- Enable **audit logging** for API requests.
- Monitor Terraform deployment logs for failures.

## 7. Additional Considerations
- **Error Handling:** Ensure the system gracefully handles failed Terraform deployments.
- **Notifications:** Implement webhook or email notifications for deployment success/failure.
- **Future Scalability:** Allow integration with other cloud providers if needed.
